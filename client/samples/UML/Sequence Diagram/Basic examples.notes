The sequence -> is used to draw a message between two participants. Participants do not have to be explicitly declared.

To have a dotted arrow, you use -->

It is also possible to use <- and <--. That does not change the drawing, but may improve readability. Note that this is only true for sequence diagrams, rules are different for the other diagrams.
