You can change arrow style by several ways:

* add a final x to denote a lost message
* use \ or / instead of < or > to have only the bottom or top part of the arrow
* repeat the arrow head (for example, >> or //) head to have a thin drawing
* use -- instead of - to have a dotted arrow
* add a final "o" at arrow head
* use bidirectional arrow
