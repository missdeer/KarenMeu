It is also possible to change arrow direction by adding left, right, up or down keywords inside the arrow.

You can shorten the arrow by using only the first character of the direction (for example, -d- instead of -down-) or the two first characters (-do-).

Please note that you should not abuse this functionality : Graphviz gives usually good results without tweaking.
