Sometimes, you will get some very large image files.

You can use the "page (hpages)x(vpages)" command to split the generated image into several files :

hpages is a number that indicated the number of horizontal pages, and vpages is a number that indicated the number of vertical pages.

You can also use some specific skinparam settings to put borders on splitted pages (see example).
