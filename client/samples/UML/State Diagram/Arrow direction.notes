You can use -> for horizontal arrows. It is possible to force arrow's direction using the following syntax:

* -down-> (default arrow)
* -right-> or ->
* -left->
* -up->

You can shorten the arrow by using only the first character of the direction (for example, -d- instead of -down-) or the two first characters (-do-).

Please note that you should not abuse this functionality : Graphviz gives usually good results without tweaking.
